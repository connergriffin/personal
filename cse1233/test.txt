	Hi, my name is Conner Griffin and I am a student at Mississippi State University. I want to be a dog walker for your company and I have many characteristics that I feel qualify me for this position. Dogs are a very important feature in my life and I hope this letter makes it clear that I have the skills and attitude requisite of a valuable employee.
	I know your company loves and cares about dogs. So, I would like to start off by saying that I have loved every dog I have ever met, regardless of disposition. In fact, I just met a dog who was very mean. Despite this, I loved him and thought he was very cute. Since I would have to meet them first, I would love every dog I walk.
	I would also be a positive presence in each dog’s life. Everyone knows that if you are good at sharing then you let people eat your snacks. I am a very kind person who loves sharing and I always have chips with me. Since chips are snacks, I would share with the dogs. Eating chips make dogs very happy which is good for your company, their owners, and themselves.
	In addition to this, as a dog walker, I would increase your company’s profits. Daily, while I am out with my puppy, everyone we pass compliments me on my dog walking skills. They say things such as, “Wow! You are very good at walking dogs. I would pay you lots of money to walk my dog.” I have even had people come up and offer me money for walking my own dog so well. From this, it seems, I am good at walking dogs and would attract more clients simply by doing my job so effectively.
	Probably my greatest contribution to your company would be my physical attributes. Every dog that gets walked needs a leash and I can hold three leashes with one hand. I have ninety leashes and thirty hands. Also, I am unnaturally dense so it takes a lot of force to pull me. Because of this, I would not lose control while walking a massive, roving horde of ninety dogs. Most humans only have two hands, cannot hold forty-five leashes in each hand, and are very light. Thus, if they tried to walk ninety dogs they would fall over, comically. This makes me significantly more efficient than the average human and will increase your profits, since I can do the work of ten people but only require the pay of one.
	As I have made clear, I am both physically and temperamentally well-equipped for a job as a dog walker and I hope you see that I would be a successful and enthusiastic employee. I have been passionate about dog walking my whole life and I am very eager to work for you. Thanks for considering my application. You can contact me through email at csg164@msstate.edu.
